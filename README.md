# Rocket Data Plot
 Takes your rocket CSV file and parses it into a snazzy graph!
 ###Dependencies:
 PYYaml, Pandas, Plot.ly, Scipy, and Numpy
## Other Info
  The example file was parsed in google sheets, and hence, the amount of data in the "time (s)" column was truncated greatly. This code is still operable with more specific units, I just need a suitable raw file to do so.
